1. Clean - Deletes the target folder / byte code + jar file
2. Validate - Validates the presence of pom.xml and src files
3. Compile - Compiles all the classes in the main directory and looks for any syntactical issue
4. Test - Compiles all the classes in the test directory and looks for any syntactical issue
5. Package - Responsible for creating a jar file and put it in the target folder
6. Verify - Similar to validate, not very important phase, it just verifies whether you have a jar file or not
7. Install - Copies the jar present in target folder to the local repository. Useful in scenarios when one local project depends on another local project
8. Site - Just checks for settings.xml and verifies if thereâ€™s a remote repo present or not
9. Deploy - Deploys the jar from local repo to the remote repo so that other developers working on the same project can clone the latest changes


// TODO:
1. Try to change the local repo's location from .m2 to something else\
2. Try to change the target folder's name
